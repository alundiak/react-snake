# React Snake

My implementation of popular game 'Snake' in TypeScript, React and CSS grid.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

as

```
npx create-react-app react-snake --template typescript
```


## Prettier

In fact I did have conflict between formatters: built-in in VScode JS/TS and recently installed `deno fmt`.
And I didn't know, VScode stopped working because of ambiguity. Interesting experience. I started configuring Prettier, and it also didn't work. But then I realized, notifications at the bottom of VSCode, where I got understanding of conflict.
