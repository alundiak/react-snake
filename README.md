# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

as

```
npx create-react-app react-snake --template typescript
```

In fact I did have conflict between formatters: built-in in VScode JS/TS and recently installed Deno fmt.
And I didn't know, VScode stopped working because of ambiguity.
